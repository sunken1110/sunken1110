### Hello, World!

My name is Seonggeun Kim ðŸ¤—.
I finished my Ph.D. in Mathematical Science at KAIST(Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology),
studied Information Theory and Cryptography(especially Post-quantum).

Now I'm working on AI/ML Data Scientist at Samsung Fire and Marine Insurance with many actuarial experts.
My current focus is LLM, and also VERY VERY interested in software engineering! ðŸ˜†

Some of my recent projects contain:

- Conversational AI (sequential chatbot)
